package is a Go keyword that defines which code bundle this file belongs to. There can be only one package per folder, and each .go file has to declare the same package name at the top of its file. In this example, the code belongs to the main package.

import is a Go keyword that tells the Go compiler which other packages you want to use in this file. Here you import the fmt package that comes with the standard library. The fmt package provides formatting and printing functions that can be useful when developing.

fmt.Println is a Go function, found in the fmt package, that tells the computer to print some text to the screen.

You follow the fmt.Println function by a sequence of characters, like "Hello, World!", enclosed in quotation marks. Any characters that are inside of quotation marks are called a string. The fmt.Println function will print this string to the screen when the program runs.
